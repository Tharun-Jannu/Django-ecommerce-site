Cover letter:
I am excited to apply for the Software developer position. With over 2+ years of experience in Angular JS, React JS, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I excel in designing and maintaining dynamic web applications. My strong collaboration skills and expertise drive project success. I am impressed by your innovative approach and am eager to contribute my technical expertise and passion for high-quality web solutions to your team.

During my tenure, I worked on a dynamic transportionstion web application project. As a front-end developer, I utilized AngularJS 
and React JS, employing TypeScript and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. The project involved integrating 
REST APIs for efficient data exchange and using HttpClient to ensure seamless communication between the client and server. 
I applied Agile Scrum methodologies, including daily standups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews, to maintain iterative
progress and ensure timely delivery. To expand my skill set and pursue full-stack development, I learned Python and Django, 
which I used to handle server-side logic and database operations. SQL was utilized for effective data management and retrieval, 
supporting CRUD operations within the application. This experience allowed me to build a comprehensive e-commerce platform 
with robust front-end and back-end functionalities.
